# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
User.create(name: "Enrique Rueda", email: "ruedaenr@grinnell.edu")
User.create(name: "Michael Hartl", email: "hartl@railstutorial.org")
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
